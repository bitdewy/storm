Storm is a distributed realtime computation system. Similar to how Hadoop provides a set of general primitives for doing batch processing, Storm provides a set of general primitives for doing realtime computation. Storm is simple, can be used with any programming language, [is used by many companies](https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/wiki/Powered-By), and is a lot of fun to use!

### Getting help

__NOTE:__ The google groups account storm-user@googlegroups.com is now officially deprecated in favor of the Apache-hosted user/dev mailing lists.

#### Storm Users
Storm users should send messages and subscribe to [user@storm.incubator.apache.org](mailto:user@storm.incubator.apache.org).

You can subscribe to this list by sending an email to [user-subscribe@storm.incubator.apache.org](mailto:user-subscribe@storm.incubator.apache.org). Likewise, you can cancel a subscription by sending an email to [user-unsubscribe@storm.incubator.apache.org](mailto:user-unsubscribe@storm.incubator.apache.org).

You can view the archives of the mailing list [here](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-storm-user/).

#### Storm Developers
Storm developers should send messages and subscribe to [dev@storm.incubator.apache.org](mailto:dev@storm.incubator.apache.org).

You can subscribe to this list by sending an email to [dev-subscribe@storm.incubator.apache.org](mailto:dev-subscribe@storm.incubator.apache.org). Likewise, you can cancel a subscription by sending an email to [dev-unsubscribe@storm.incubator.apache.org](mailto:dev-unsubscribe@storm.incubator.apache.org).

You can view the archives of the mailing list [here](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-storm-dev/).

#### Which list should I send/subscribe to?
If you are using a pre-built binary distribution of Storm, then chances are you should send questions, comments, storm-related announcements, etc. to [user@storm.apache.incubator.org](user@storm.apache.incubator.org). 

If you are building storm from source, developing new features, or otherwise hacking storm source code, then [dev@storm.incubator.apache.org](dev@storm.incubator.apache.org) is more appropriate. 

#### What will happen with storm-user@googlegroups.com?
All existing messages will remain archived there, and can be accessed/searched [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/storm-user).

New messages sent to storm-user@googlegroups.com will either be rejected/bounced or replied to with a message to direct the email to the appropriate Apache-hosted group.

#### IRC
You can also come to the #storm-user room on [freenode](http://freenode.net/). You can usually find a Storm developer there to help you out.
