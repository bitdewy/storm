Specifically, it uses Storm as the basis for one of three of its cloud data services - namely, Data Delivery Services (DDS), which uses Storm to provide a fault-tolerant and linearly scalable enterprise data collection, transport, and complex in-stream processing cloud service. 
</p>

<p>
In much the same way that Hadoop provides batch ETL and large-scale batch analytical processing, the Data Delivery Service provides real-time ETL and large-scale real-time analytical processing — the perfect complement to Hadoop (or in some cases, what you needed instead of Hadoop).
</p>

<p>
DDS uses both Storm and Kafka along with a host of additional technologies to provide an enterprise-class real-time stream processing solution with features including:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Integration connections to any variety of data sources in a way that is robust yet as non-invasive
</li>
<li>
Optimizations for highly scalable, reliable data import and distributed ETL (extract, transform, load), fulfilling data transport needs
</li>
<li>
Developer tools for rapid development of decorators, which perform the real-time stream processing
</li>
<li>
Guaranteed delivery framework and data failover snapshots to send processed data to analytics systems, databases, file systems, and applications with extreme reliability
</li>
<li>
Rapid solution development and deployment, along with our expert Big Data methodology and best practices
</li>
</ul>

<p>Infochimps has extensive experience in deploying its DDS to power large-scale clickstream web data flows, massive Twitter stream processes, Foursquare event processing, customer purchase data, product pricing data, and more.

<p>At the heart of our products, Storm helps us to stream real-time meta-search data from our partners to end-users. Since data comes from many sources and with different timing, Storm topology concept naturally solves concurrency issues while helping us to continuously merge, slice and clean all the data. Additionally with a few tricks and tools provided in Storm we can easily apply incremental update to improve the flow our data (1-5GB/minute).</p>
 
<p>With its simplicity, scalability, and flexibility, Storm does not only improve our current products but more importantly changes the way we work with data. Instead of keeping data static and crunching it once a while, we constantly move data all around, making use of different technologies, evaluating new ideas and building new products. We stream critical data to memory for fast access while continuously crunching and directing huge amount of data into various engines so that we can evaluate and make use of data instantly. Previously, this kind of system requires to setup and maintain quite a few things but with Storm all we need is half day of coding and a few seconds to deploy. In this sense we never think Storm is to serve our products but rather to evolve our products.</p>

CrowdFlower is using Storm with Kafka to generalize our data stream
aggregation and realtime computation infrastructure. We replaced our
homegrown aggregation solutions with Storm because it simplified the
creation of fault tolerant systems. We were already using Zookeeper
and Kafka, so Storm allowed us to build more generic abstractions for
our analytics using tools that we had already deployed and
battle-tested in production.
</p>

<p>
We are currently writing to DynamoDB from Storm, so we are able to
scale our capacity quickly by bringing up additional supervisors and
tweaking the throughput on our Dynamo tables. We look forward to
exploring other uses for Storm in our system, especially with the
recent release of Trident.

<p>
At Digital Sandbox we use Storm to enable our open source information feed monitoring system.  The system uses Storm to constantly monitor and pull data from structured and unstructured information sources across the internet.  For each found item, our topology applies natural language processing based concept analysis, temporal analysis, geospatial analytics and a prioritization algorithm to enable users to monitor large special events, public safety operations, and topics of interest to a multitude of individual users and teams.
</p>
 
<p>
Our system is built using Storm for feed retrieval and annotation, Python with Flask and jQuery for business logic and web interfaces, and MongoDB for data persistence. We use NTLK for natural language processing and the WordNet, GeoNames, and OpenStreetMap databases to enable feed item concept extraction and geolocation.

With several mainstream celebrities and very popular YouTubers using Hallo to communicate with their fans, we needed a good solution to notify users via push notifications and make sure that the celebrity messages were delivered to follower timelines in near realtime. Our initial approach for broadcast push notifications would take anywhere from 2-3 hours. After re-engineering our solution on top of Storm, that time has been cut down to 5 minutes on a very small cluster. With the user base growing and user need for realtime communication, we are very happy knowing that we can easily scale Storm by adding nodes to maintain a baseline QoS for our users.

various push and pull sources, including a Kestrel queue, filter and
enrich the events in Storm topologies, and persist the events to Redis,
HDFS and Vertica for real-time analytics and archiving. We are currently
experimenting with Trident topologies, and figuring out how to move more
of our Hadoop-based batch processing into Storm.

TheLadders has been committed to finding the right person for the right job since 2003. We're using Storm in a variety of ways and are happy with its versatility, robustness, and ease of development. We use Storm in conjunction with RabbitMQ for such things as sending hiring alerts: when a recruiter submits a job to our site, Storm processes that event and will aggregate jobseekers whose profiles match the position. That list is subsequently batch-processed to send an email to the list of jobseekers. We also use Storm to persist events for Business Intelligence and internal event tracking. We're continuing to find uses for Storm where fast, asynchronous, real-time event processing is a must.
